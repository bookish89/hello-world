# hello-world
I'm currently seting up my first repository on github - beginning a new chapter in my coding adventure. 

## About me

I'm currently 32 years old and working as a manager at a college bookstore. I've grown so much since I graduated high school, began working, went to college, and graduated. I learned a bit more about who I am and what I like to do. I grew more confident and learned I had a voice. I realized how little I valued myself and what I had to offer, and I'm finally pursuing something that I find interesting and challenging and will allow me to grow every single day as I strive to know just that much more or a different way to accomplish the same thing.

--Ralph Waldo Emerson

## Every day things become a little more clear and the horizon wider as I gain the tools to do and the understanding of what I'm working on to get me that much closer to what I actually want to make.

Every video I watch, every article I read, gives me the confidence I need to pursue that next step or go back and fix somethign I didn't realize I didn't quite understand how it worked to improve a previous project or the current project.
